I made a chrome extension that helps me maintain an elevated heart rate while I exercise. The extension connects to Bluetooth low energy heart rate monitors. If I slow down while exercising, thus causing my heart rate to dip below my desired heart rate, the extension pauses streaming as a penalty. I am able to un-pause the video when I raise my heart rate by increasing my exercise intensity.
